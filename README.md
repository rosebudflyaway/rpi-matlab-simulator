# rpi-matlab-simulator
RPI-MATLAB-Simulator (RPIsim) is an open source simulation framework
for research and education in multibody dynamics available from rpi-matlab-
simulator. RPIsim is designed and organized to be extended. Its modular de-
sign allows users to edit or add new components without worrying about extra
implementation details. RPIsim has two main goals:
1. Provide an intuitive and easily extendable platform for research and edu-
cation in multibody dynamics
2. Maintain an evolving code base of useful algorithms and analysis tools for
multibody dynamics problems.
